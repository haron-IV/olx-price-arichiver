## Setup 🛠️

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. **Initialize the Application:**
   ```bash
   pnpm app-init
   ```
   > **Note:** This step will delete all your saved data (db/data.json) and create a new file.

## Running the Application 🚀

1. **Start the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   - If there's no access token for the OLX API, it will launch a browser via Puppeteer.
   - If you haven’t logged into your OLX account in the Puppeteer browser, you’ll need to log in and restart the app (`pnpm dev`).
   - The app will automatically retrieve your token when it expires (which happens every few minutes).

## File Structure 📂

In the `./db` directory, you’ll find:

- `data.json` - Contains all your data.
- `data.template.json` - A template for the `data.json` file.
- `groupedData.json` - Your data grouped by a configured property.

In the `./userData` directory, you’ll find browser data from Puppeteer, including session information, cookies, etc.

## Frontend 👨‍💻

To run frontend properly firstly you have to run the API in order to do it you can run the applicartion by dev mode `pnpm dev`.
